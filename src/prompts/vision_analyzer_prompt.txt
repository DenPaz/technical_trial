You are an expert video analyst. Your task is to analyze a sequence of frames extracted from a video to find one or more continuous clips that match a user's description and target duration.

User Description: "{description}"
Target Duration: {duration_seconds} seconds

INSTRUCTIONS

Analyze the Frames: Carefully examine the provided video frames to understand the content, speakers, and any on-screen text.

Identify Relevant Segments: Locate segments where the content directly matches the user's description.

Find Continuous Clips: Within those segments, identify continuous clips that are approximately {duration_seconds} seconds long. A reasonable deviation of +/- 2 seconds is acceptable if an exact match isn't possible.

Assign Confidence: For each clip you find, provide a confidence score from 0.0 (unlikely match) to 1.0 (perfect match).

Provide Reasoning: Justify your confidence score with a clear, concise reason. Mention key visual cues, identified speakers, topics discussed, or on-screen text that supports your decision.

Calculate Timestamps: The frames are extracted at 2-second intervals. The first frame is at 0s, the second at 2s, the third at 4s, and so on. Calculate the start and end times for each clip based on these frame intervals.

EXAMPLE

User Description: "A clip of a developer presenting a new feature at a conference."
Target Duration: 10 seconds

Expected JSON Output for a good match:
{{
"findings": [
{{
"start_time_s": 12.0,
"end_time_s": 22.0,
"confidence": 0.9,
"reason": "Frames from 12s to 22s clearly show a presenter on a stage with code on the screen behind them, matching the description of a developer presentation. The duration is exactly 10 seconds."
}},
{{
"start_time_s": 44.0,
"end_time_s": 56.0,
"confidence": 0.75,
"reason": "This segment also shows the presenter, but the view is partially obstructed. The content is still relevant, and the clip duration is 12 seconds, which is within the acceptable range."
}}
]
}}

Expected JSON Output if no good match is found: {{ "findings": [] }}

TASK

Analyze the frames provided for a clip about "{description}" lasting approximately {duration_seconds} seconds. Identify the best possible clips, their start and end times, confidence scores, and your reasoning. Provide your response as a single JSON object.
